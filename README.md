# jeppy

fun little project that scrapes historical jeopardy questions/answers from https://www.j-archive.com and writes them to a sqlite database

## overview

- `jeppy/scraper`: get raw data and dump to json
- `backend/`: contains flask app to handle db operations
- `frontend/`: contains react app that fetches data, renders it, and handles gameplay

## setup

### scraper

From the root of the repo run `make scrape`.

### backend

```{bash}
cd backend                      # move into the backend/ directory
python -m venv venv             # create a virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate      # activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # install requirements

python                          # open a python shell
>>> from app import db          # import the db object from the project
>>> db.create_all()             # run SQLAlchemy's create_all func to create the db and tables
>>> from app import populateDB  # import the helper func to populate the db
>>> populateDB()                # run the populate function
>>> quit()                      # exit the python shell

sqlite3 jeppy.db                    # open the sqlite shell
sqlite> select count(*) from clue;  # check the number of rows in the clue table
59                                  # confirm there are rows in the table
sqlite> .quit                       # exit the sqlite shell
```

Validate the flask app handles requests as expected:

- start the flask app

```{bash}
python app.py  
```

- in another terminal query for clues for a `game_id`

```{bash}
curl -G http://localhost:5000/clues --data-urlencode "game_id=Show #8236 - Monday, September 14, 2020"
```

- this should return json data

### frontend

```{bash}
cd frontend/client      # move into the client/ directory
yarn                    # install dependencies
yarn start              # start the react app
```

## work in progress demo

`make practice`
