Bugs:
    ☐ something wonky is going on with formatting in the readme: `MD010/no-hard-tabs: Hard tabs [Column: 1]`
    ☐ something wonky with the bottom margin of text in the buttons and clues (hacky solution in place)

General Improvements:
    ☐ unit tests and doc comments
    ☐ need more comments everywhere
    ☐ come up with a better way to handle the config constants in `consts.ts` 
    ☐ handle ending the game (after all double jep clues are played)

Frontend:
    ☐ style the landing page
    ☐ add instructions to landing page
    ☐ double jeopardy
    ☐ allow players to enter their names
    ☐ some category names are too long for their box

Database:
    ☐ split the `game_id` column into two columns (id and date)
    ☐ add a `game` table to keep track of game level stats / things

Ideas:
    ☐ landing page to choose a historical game to play or pick categories?
    ✔ scorekeeping? @done(21-03-20 10:42)
    ☐ practice mode
    ☐ daily doubles?
    ☐ final jep?
    ☐ persist scores in the db?
