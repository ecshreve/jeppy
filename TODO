Bugs:
    ☐ something wonky is going on with formatting in the readme: `MD010/no-hard-tabs: Hard tabs [Column: 1]`
    ☐ something wonky with the bottom margin of text in the buttons and clues

General Improvements:
    ☐ unit tests and doc comments
    ☐ need more comments everywhere
    ☐ come up with a better way to handle the config constants in `consts.ts` 

Database:
    ☐ split the `game_id` column into two columns (id and date)
    ☐ add a `game` table to keep track of game level stats / things

Ideas:
